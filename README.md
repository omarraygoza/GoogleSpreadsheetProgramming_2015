# GoogleSpreadsheetProgramming_2015
Contains all code examples given in the 2015 version of my Leanpub book "Google Spreadsheet Programming". 
Each chapter is given its own GAS file (.gs).

This is an old book published by leanpub, but now it's removed.
This is a like piece a solid gold from Google Apps Script (GAS), it was one of my first books on GAS: @omar_raygoza
